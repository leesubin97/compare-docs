The shear strength of concrete beams and columns shall be determined in accordance with 11.1 to 11.5 of this code increased by the DIF ofC.2. These provisions shall also apply in cases of reaction shear at supported edges of slabs and walls. Punching shear strength ofslabs and walls shall be determined in accordance with 11.11 of this code, increased by the DIF of C.2. C.6 Impulsive effects C.6.1 Impulsive loads shall be considered incombination with other loadsasrequired by9.1 ofthis code andinaccordance withC.8 of this appendix. C.6.2 When reinforced concrete structural elements or systems of elements are subjected to impulsive loads, the structural response may be determined by one ofthe followingmethods: a) The dynamic effectsofthe impulsive loads may be considered by calculatinga dynamic load factor(DLF). The resistance available for the impulsive load must be at least equal to the peak of the impulsive load transient multiplied bytheDLF. The calculation of the DLF shall be based on the ductility criteria in C.3 and the dynamic characteristics of the structure and impulsive load transient. b) The dynamic effects of impulsive loads may be considered by using impulse, momentum, and energy balance techniques. Strain energy capacity is limitedby the ductility criteria in C.3. c) The dynamic effects of impulsive loads may be considered by performing a time-history dynamic analysis. Massand inertial properties shall be included as well as the nonlinear stiffnesses of structural elements under consideration. Simplified bilinear definitions ofstiffness areacceptable. Maximum predicted response is governedby the ductility criteria in C.3. C.7-Impactive effects C.7.1 Design for impactive loads shall satisfy the criteria for both local effects and for overall structural response.  C.7.2 Local impacteffects may include penetration, perforation, scabbing, and punching shear. C.7.2.1 The penetration depth and required concrete thickness t0preventperforation shall be based upon applicable formulas or pertinent testdata. When perforation ofconcrete structural elements must be precluded, the concrete thickness shall be at least 20 percent greater than that requiredto prevent perforation. C.7.2.2 Concrete structural elements protecting required system or equipment which could be damaged by secondary missiles (fragments of scabbed concrete) shall be designed to prevent scabbing, or a properly designed scab shield shall be based on applicable formulas or pertinent test data. In the absence of scab shields, the concrete thickness shall be at least 20 percent greater than that required to prevent scabbing. C.7.2.3 When it can be demonstrated by applicableformulas or pertinent test data that the concrete thickness 1S at least20 percent greaterthanthat requiredt0preventperforation and hence punching shear failure, design for punching shear in accordance withC.5 not required.  C.7.2.4 Forconcrete slabs or wallssubjected t0missile impact effects where the concrete thickness 1S less than twice that required to prevent perforation, the minmmum percentage of reinforcement shall be0.2 percent each way, each face. C.7.3 When reinforced concrete structural elements or systems of elements are subjected to impactive loads, the structural response may be determined by the methods described inC.6.2. C.8- Impactive and impulsive loads Impactive and impulsive loads must be considered concurrent with other loads (e.g-, dead and live load) in determmnn the required resistance ofstructural elements.
